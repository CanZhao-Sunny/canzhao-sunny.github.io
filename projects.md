The mechanical parameters, such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, are crucial for the force perception capabilities of the tactile sensor. However, there are few methods that can retrieve values of these parameters both accurately and conveniently. To address this problem, we propose **an in-situ approach to calibrate mechanical parameters** other than the verbose traditional evaluation process. Our method incorporates the deformation sensing capability of the sensor, the accurate force sensing capability of a force/torque sensor, and most importantly, the deformation-force relation-ship for an indentation with embedded mechanical parameters of the elastomers. We present the indentation test setup and the complete pipeline to extract Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio from experimental results. We validate the method by comparing the indentation depths simulated through finite element analysis (FEA) using the calibrated parameters with the indentation depths measured in real experiments. Furthermore, superior contact force distribution can be achieved with the accurate mechanical parameters. The proposed method provides the theoretical basis for accurate, lifelong routine calibration, whether weekly or even daily, which can enhance the applications of tactile sensors in real manipulation scenarios.

Vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile information through high-resolution tactile images, enabling the reconstruction of dense contact force fields on the sensor surface. However, accurately reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) contact force distribution, including tangential components, remains a challenge. We propose **the multi-layer inverse finite element method (iFEM2.0)** as a robust and generalized approach to reconstruct dense contact force distribution for vision-based tactile sensors. We systematically analyze various parameters within the iFEM2.0 framework, and determine the appropriate parameter combinations through simulation comparisons and in-situ mechanical calibration. Our approach incorporates multi-layer mesh constraints, ridge regularization, and filtering mechanisms to enhance robustness. Furthermore, since there exists no off-the-shelf measurement equipment or criterion metrics for 3D contact force distribution perception, we present a comprehensive assessment benchmark covering accuracy, fidelity, and noise resistance that can serve as a cornerstone for other future force distribution reconstruction methods. The proposed iFEM2.0 demonstrates good performance in both simulation- and experiment-based evaluations. Such dense 3D contact force information is critical for enabling dexterous robotic manipulation that handles both rigid and soft materials.





## Undergraduate Projects

### **LightGBM: an efficient and accurate method for predicting pregnancy diseases**

- Sept. 2020 - Sept. 2021
- Laboratory of Biomechanics Engneering, Sichuan University
- Advisor: Prof. Yu Chen
- Published 1 [journal paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443615.2021.1945006)

As machine learning is becoming the fashion in disease prediction while no prediction model has performed very efficiently and accurately on predicting pregnancy diseases up to now, it’s necessary to compare several common machine learning methods’ performance on pregnancy diseases prediction and select out the best one. The data of two common pregnancy complications, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), based on various maternal characteristics measured in patients’ routine blood examination in 10–19 weeks of gestation are considered to be suitable to be learned. This is a retrospective study of 320 healthy pregnancies in 10–19 weeks, with 149 patients who subsequently developed PIH and 250 patients who subsequently developed ICP. Nine machine learning methods were used to predict PIH and ICP and their performance was compared via 8 evaluation indexes. Finally, the light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM) is considered to be the best method to predict gestational diseases.



### **Application of machine learning in disease prediction (Review)**

- Nov. 2019 – Dec. 2020
- Laboratory of Biomechanics Engneering, Sichuan University
- Advisor: Prof. Yu Chen
- Published 1 [journal paper](https://swyxgcyj.com/oa/DArticle.aspx?type=view&id=20210217)

We expound the concept and classification of machine learning and introduce several common kinds of machine learning methods applied on medical disease production practice, such as K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bales, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, integrated tree models and artificial neural networks, we focus on the machine learning application in the prediction of some common diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney diseases, tumor, pregnancy diseases and so on. We mainly analyze the characteristics of machine learning in disease prediction from three aspects: feature selection, algorithm and model accuracy.
