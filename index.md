## Research Interests

- Tactile perception & force sensing
- Modeling and manipulation of deformable objects
- Applied Machine Learning
- [My latest research proposal](https://canzhao-sunny.github.io/file/proposal-2023.pdf)üîó

My current research focuses on the modeling, perception and manipulation of deformable objects, aiming to make it robust, practical, and easy-to-apply. In addition, I‚Äôm broadly interested in machine learning, force sensing, and tactile perception with their applications to robotic dexterous manipulation of various objects.

In a word, advanced technologies like robotics and  ML positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
